## üé® Customization Examples

### **Theme Park Setup**
```luau
-- Great for showcase areas
interactionRange = 8,
lightingPreset = "Studio",
rotationSpeed = 0.5,
```

### **Social Hub**

-- Players showing off outfits
interactionRange = 15,
lightingPreset = "Natural", 
rotationSpeed = 1.2,

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **Stand Won't Create**
- Check if you have permissions (server validates ownership)
- Try moving to a different location
- Ensure you're not at the max stand limit per player

### **Avatar Not Updating**
- Stand avatar updates are server-authoritative
- Changes may take 1-2 seconds to sync to all clients
- Try refreshing by walking away and back

### **Performance Issues**
- Reduce `maxVisibleStands` in config
- Increase `cullingDistance` to load fewer stands
- Check for too many stands in one area

### **UI Not Appearing**
- Ensure you're within interaction range of a stand
- Check console for any script errors
- UI auto-hides after 30 seconds of no interaction

## üîß Integration Tips

### **Adding to Existing Games**
1. Copy the `src/` folder structure to your project
2. Ensure DataStore API is enabled in game settings
3. Add creation buttons to your existing UI systems
4. Configure interaction ranges for your game's scale

### **Custom UI Integration**
- Hook into the State system for reactive UI updates
- Use RemoteSignal events to trigger custom animations
- Access stand data through the client manager

### **Monetization Ideas**
- Premium lighting presets
- Exclusive avatar items for stands
- Stand decoration/background systems
- Social features (likes, comments, sharing)
